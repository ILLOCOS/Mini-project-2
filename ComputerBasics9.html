                    You may have heard people talking about using a <b>program</b>, an <b>application</b>, or an <b> app</b>. But what exactly does that mean? Simply put, an <b>app</b> is a type of software that allows you to <b>perform specific tasks</b>. Applications for desktop or laptop computers are sometimes called <b>desktop applications</b>, while those for mobile devices are called <b> mobile apps.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When you open an application, it runs inside the <b>operating system</b> until you close it. Most of the time, you will have more than one application open at the same time, which is known as <b>multi-tasking.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>App</b> is a common term for an <b>application</b>, especially for <b>simple applications</b> that can be downloaded <b>inexpensively</b> or even <b>for free</b>. Many apps are also available for <b>mobile devices</b> and even some <b>TVs.</b>
                </p>

                   <h3>Desktop applications</h3>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    There are countless desktop applications, and they fall into several categories. Some are more <b>full featured</b> (like <b>Microsoft Word</b> ), while others may only do <b>one or two things</b> (like a <b>clock</b> or <b>calendar</b> app). Below are just a few types of applications you might use.
                   </p>
