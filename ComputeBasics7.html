                    A mobile device is a general term for any type of <b>handheld computer</b>. These devices are designed to be extremely portable, and they can often fit in your hand. Some mobile devices—like <b>tablets, e-readers</b>, and <b>smartphones</b>—are powerful enough to do many of the same things you can do with a desktop or laptop computer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Tablet computers</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Like laptops,<b> tablet computers</b> are designed to be portable. However, they provide a different computing experience. The most obvious difference is that tablet computers don't have keyboards or touchpads. Instead, the entire screen is touch-sensitive, allowing you to type on a <b> virtual keyboard</b> and use your finger as a mouse pointer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tablet computers can't necessarily do everything traditional computers can do. For many people, a traditional computer like a <b>desktop</b> or <b> laptop</b> is still needed in order to use some programs. However, the convenience of a tablet computer means it may be ideal as a <b>second computer.</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>E-readers</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                   <b> E-book readers</b> —also called <b>e-readers</b> —are similar to tablet computers, except they are mainly designed for reading <b>e-books</b> (digital, downloadable books). Notable examples include the <b>Amazon Kindle, Barnes & Noble Nook, and Kobo.</b> Most e-readers use an <b>e-ink</b> display, which is easier to read than a traditional computer display. You can even read in bright sunlight, just like if you were reading a regular book.
                </p>

                <h3>Smartphones</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A smartphone is a more powerful version of a traditional cell phone. In addition to the same basic features—phone calls, voicemail, text messaging—smartphones can <b>connect to the Internet</b> over Wi-Fi or a cellular network (which requires purchasing a monthly data plan). This means you can use a smartphone for the same things you would normally do on a computer, such as checking your email, browsing the Web, or shopping online.
                </p>
                <img src="media/tomChapter2Img20.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">
                <p>
                    Most smartphones use a <b>touch-sensitive screen</b>, meaning there isn't a physical keyboard on the device. Instead, you'll type on a virtual keyboard and use your fingers to interact with the display. Other standard features include a high-quality digital camera and the ability to play digital music and video files. For many people, a smartphone can actually replace electronics like an old laptop, digital music player, and digital camera in the same device.
