        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <div class="content p-5">
            <p>
              The basic parts of a desktop computer are the <b>computer case, monitor, keyboard, mouse,</b> and <b>power cord</b>. Each part plays an <b>important role</b> whenever you use a computer.
            </p>

             <h3>Computer case</h3>
             <img src="media/tomChapter2Img1.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

             <p>
              The <b>computer case</b> is the metal and plastic box that <b>contains the main components</b> of the computer, including the motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), and power supply. The front of the case usually has an <b>On/Off button</b> and one or more <b>optical drives.</b>
             </p>

             <br>
             <p>
              Computer cases come in different shapes and sizes. A <b>desktop case</b> lies flat on a desk, and the monitor usually sits on top of it. A <b>tower case</b> is tall and sits next to the monitor or on the floor. <b>All-in-one </b> computers come with the internal components built into the monitor, which eliminates the need for a separate case.
             </p>
             <br>

             <h3>Monitor</h3>
             <img src="media/tomChapter2Img2.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

             <p>
              The <b>monitor</b> works with a <b> video card</b>, located inside the computer case, to display images and text on the screen. Most monitors have <b>control buttons</b> that allow you to change your monitor's display settings, and some monitors also have built-in speakers.
             </p>
             <br>

             <p>
              Newer monitors usually have <b>LCD</b> (liquid crystal display) or <b>LED</b> (light-emitting diode) displays. These can be made very thin, and they are often called <b>flat-panel displays</b>. Older monitors use
              <b> CRT</b> (cathode ray tube) displays. CRT monitors are much larger and heavier, and they take up more desk space.
             </p>
             <br><br>
             <h3>Keyboard</h3>
             <br>
             <p>
              The <b>keyboard</b> is one of the main ways to communicate with a computer. There are many different types of keyboards, but most are <b>very similar</b> and allow you to accomplish the same basic tasks.
             </p>

             <img src="media/tomChapter2Img3.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

             <h3>Mouse</h3>
             <img src="media/tomChapter2Img4.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

             <p>
              The <b> mouse</b> is another important tool for communicating with computers. Commonly known as a <b>pointing device</b> , it lets you <b>point</b> to objects on the screen, <b>click</b> on them, and <b>move</b> them.
             </p>
             <br>

             <p>
              There are two main mouse types: optical and mechanical. The <b>optical</b> mouse uses an electronic eye to detect movement and is easier to clean. The <b>mechanical mouse</b> uses a rolling ball to detect movement and requires regular cleaning to work properly.
             </p>
        </div>
          <h1>Mouse alternatives</h1>
          <div class="content p-5">
            <p>
              There are other devices that can do the same thing as a mouse. Many people find them easier to use, and they also require less desk space than a traditional mouse. The most common mouse alternatives are below.
            </p>

            <div class="p-4">
              <p>
                <b>> Trackball:</b> A trackball has a ball that can rotate freely. Instead of moving the device like a mouse, you can roll the ball with your thumb to move the pointer.
              </p>
              <br>

              <p>
                <b>> Touchpad:</b> A touchpad—also called a trackpad—is a touch-sensitive pad that lets you control the pointer by making a drawing motion with your finger. Touchpads are common on laptop computers.

         <h1>Introduction</h1>

         <div class="content p-5">
            <p>
              Take a look at the front and back of your computer case and count the number of <b>buttons, ports, </b>and <b>slots</b> you see. Now look at your monitor and count any you find there. You probably counted at least 10, and maybe a lot more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Each computer is different, so the buttons, ports, and sockets will <b> vary from computer to computer</b>. However, there are certain ones you can expect to find on most desktop computers. Learning how these ports are used will help whenever you need to connect something to your computer, like a new printer, keyboard, or mouse.
            </p>

          <div class="content p-5">
            <h3>Optical Disc Drive</h3>
            <p>
              Often called a <b>CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive,</b> this lets your computer read CDs and DVDs.
            </p>
            <img src="media/tomChapter2Img6.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

            <h3>Power Button</h3>
            <p>
              The power button is used to power the computer <b>on and off.</b>
            </p>
            <img src="media/tomChapter2Img6.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

            <h3>Audio In/Audio Out</h3>
            <p>
              Many computers include <b> audio ports</b> on the front of the computer case that allow you to easily connect <b>speakers,microphones,</b> and <b>headsets</b> without fumbling with the back of the computer.
            </p>
            <img src="media/tomChapter2Img6.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

            <h3>USB (Universal Serial Bus) Port</h3>
            <p>
              Most desktop computers have several <b> USB ports</b> . These can be used to connect almost any type of device, including mice, keyboards, printers, and digital cameras. They will often appear on the front and back of the computer.
            </p>
            <img src="media/tomChapter2Img6.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">
          </div>

          <h1>Back of a computer case</h1>
            <div class="content p-5">
              <p>The back of a computer case has <b> connection ports</b> that are made to fit <b>specific devices.</b> The placement will vary from computer to computer, and many companies have their own special connectors for specific devices. Some of the ports may be <b> color coded</b> to help you determine which port is used with a particular device.</p>
              <br>

              <h3>Audio In/Audio Out</h3>
              <p>
                Almost every computer has two or more <b>audio ports </b> where you can connect various devices, including speakers, microphones, and headsets.
              </p>

              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img7.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <h3>Monitor Port</h3>
              <p>
                This is where you'll connect your <b>monitor cable.</b> In this example, the computer has both a DisplayPort and a VGA port. Other computers may have other types of monitor ports, such as DVI (digital visual interface) or HDMI (high-definition multimedia interface).
              </p>

              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img7.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <h3>USB Ports</h3>
              <p>
                On most desktop computers, most of the <b>USB ports</b> are on the back of the computer case. Generally, you'll want to connect your mouse and keyboard to these ports and keep the front USB ports free so they can be used for digital cameras and other devices.
              </p>

              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img7.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <h3>Ethernet Port</h3>
              <p>
                This port looks a lot like the <b> modem</b> or telephone port, but it is slightly wider. You can use this port for <b> networking</b> and connecting to the Internet.
              </p>

              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img7.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <h3>Serial Port</h3>
              <p>
                This port is less common on today's computers. It was frequently used to connect <b>peripherals</b> like digital cameras, but it has been replaced by USB and other types of ports.
              </p>

              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img7.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <h3>Expansion Slots</h3>
              <p>
                These empty slots are where <b>expansion cards</b> are added to computers. For example, if your computer did not come with a video card, you could purchase one and install it here.
              </p>

              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img7.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <h3>Power Socket</h3>
              <p>
                This is where you'll connect the <b> power cord</b> to the computer.
              </p>

              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img7.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

            </div>

            <h1>Other types of ports</h1>
            <div class="content p-5">
              <p>
                There are many other types of ports, such as FireWire, Thunderbolt, and HDMI. If your computer has ports you don't recognize, you should consult your manual for more information.

              <h3>Motherboard</h3>
              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img8.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <p>
                The <b>motherboard</b> is the computer's <b>main circuit board</b>. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h3>CPU/processor</h3>
              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img9.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <p>
                The central processing unit (CPU), also called a <b>processor</b>, is located inside the <b>computer case</b> on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an application, you're sending instructions to the CPU.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                The CPU is usually a <b>two-inch ceramic square</b> with a <b> silicon chip</b> located inside. The chip is usually about the size of a thumbnail. The CPU fits into the motherboard's <b>CPU socket</b>, which is covered by the <b>heat sink</b>, an object that absorbs heat from the CPU.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                A processor's <b>speed</b> is measured in <b>megahertz</b> (MHz), or millions of instructions per second; and <b>gigahertz</b> (GHz), or billions of instructions per second. A faster processor can execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the computer depends on the speed of many different components—not just the processor.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <h3>RAM (random access memory)</h3>
              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img10.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <p>
                RAM is your system's <b> short-term memory</b>. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                This <b> short-term memory disappears</b> when the computer is turned off. If you're working on a document, spreadsheet, or other type of file, you'll need to save it to avoid losing it. When you <b>save</b> a file, the data is written to the hard drive, which acts as <b>long-term storage.</b>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                RAM is measured in <b>megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB)</b>. The <b> more RAM</b> you have, the more things your computer can do at the same time. If you don't have enough RAM, you may notice that your computer is sluggish when you have several programs open. Because of this, many people add <b>extra RAM</b> to their computers to improve performance.
              </p>

              <h3>Hard drive</h3>
              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img11.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <p>
                The <b>hard drive</b> is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. The hard drive is <b>long-term storage</b>, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                When you run a program or open a file, the computer copies some of the data from the <b>hard drive</b> onto the <b>RAM</b>. When you <b>save</b> a file, the data is copied back to the <b>hard drive</b>. The faster the hard drive, the faster your computer can <b>start up</b> and <b>load programs.</b>
              </p>

              <p>
                The power supply unit in a computer <b>converts the power</b> from the wall outlet to the type of power needed by the computer. It sends power through cables to the motherboard and other components.
              </p>
              <br>
              <div class="Note p-4">
                  <p>
                    If you decide to open the computer case and take a look, make sure to <b>unplug</b> the computer first. Before touching the inside of the computer, you should touch a grounded metal object—or a metal part of the computer casing—to discharge any static buildup. Static electricity can be transmitted through the computer circuits, which can seriously damage your machine.

           <h1>Expansion cards</h1>
           <div class="content p-5">
              <p>
                Most computers have <b>expansion slots</b> on the motherboard that allow you to add various types of <b>expansion cards</b>. These are sometimes called <b> PCI (peripheral component interconnect) cards</b>. You may never need to add any PCI cards because most motherboards have built-in video, sound, network, and other capabilities.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                However, if you want to boost the performance of your computer or update the capabilities of an older computer, you can always add one or more cards. Below are some of the most common types of expansion cards.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Video card</h3>
              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img12.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <p>
                The <b> video card</b> is responsible for what you see on the monitor. Most computers have a <b>GPU (graphics processing unit)</b> built into the motherboard instead of having a separate video card. If you like playing graphics-intensive games, you can add a faster video card to one of the <b>expansion slots</b> to get better performance.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>Network card</h3>
              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img13.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <p>
                The <b>network card</b> allows your computer to communicate over a network and access the Internet. It can either connect with an <b> Ethernet</b> cable or through a <b>wireless</b> connection (often called <b>Wi-Fi</b> ). Many motherboards have built-in network connections, and a network card can also be added to an expansion slot.
              </p>
              <br>

              <h3>Bluetooth card (or adapter)</h3>
              <img src="media/tomChapter2Img14.jpg" alt="image" class="img-fluid p-5">

              <p>
                Bluetooth is a technology for wireless communication over short distances. It's often used in computers to communicate with wireless <b>keyboards, mice, and printers</b>. It's commonly built into the motherboard or included in a <b>wireless network card</b>. For computers that don't have Bluetooth, you can purchase a USB adapter, often called a <b>dongle.</b>
